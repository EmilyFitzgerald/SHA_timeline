In Australia this was followed by a hyphen and the letters AU. In 1928 the International Commission for Air Navigation revised the system and allocated the primary letters VH to Australia. These letters were followed by a hyphen and three further letters. In making the change the old registration was followed as closely as possible, thus G-AUEF, after it crashed in July 1925 was rebuilt and later registered as
VH-UEF.
